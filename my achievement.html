<h5>it has been a great privilege to be a student of Kwara State University Malete. My Name is Adeyi Fridaus Opeyemi i hail from Ilorin Kwara State Ilorin West to be precise from the family of two my religion is Islam. 
<p>my Achievement so far will all be written down here </p>Firstly i will like to start from my primary school named Owo Nusery and Primary School Ijeshatedo Surulere Lagos State Nigeria .During my Primary School I had the opportunity to participate in lot of activities like drama,sport and more of learning actiivities i also had the oppotunity to visit a lot place like museums ,zoo and television station (N.T.A
)<p>my Achievement during my primary school days was that i was taught on how to know about social activities and also i was been educated on how to interact with people in life and most importantly to be always bold and confident of my self anywhere life leads me to</p>
<p>Futhermore, I graduated from my primary school and proceed to Secondary School Named 
Alexander college of Art and Science situated at Olorunsogo Upper Gaa-Akanbi District Ilorin Kwara State .</p>During my Secondary days it was not in any way similar to my primary days there i had the chance to meet a lot of people from different background ,tribe and most importantly different character.<p>the years been spent in secondary school i had the privilege to understand a lot of people and also found out that life on it whole is a battle field where you have lot of people who will not really support your achievement and to be careful of life itself</p><p>After those memorable years of my secondary school and with my excellent performance of my good result i gained admission to a World Class University named Kwara State University Malete located at Ilorin Kwara State from the Department of Library and Information College of Information Communication Technology 200 Level to be precise</p><p>However in any higher insitution it like you been on a journey but have not gotten to your destination in life university it self is a big journey there you meet  lot of people .those who are willingly to help acedemically and those set of categories who take university for granted.</p><p>finally i will like to say have not been able to have so much achievement reason that am still a student </p><p>but with those little knowledge i have gotten so far it has taught me to be careful of people who i will relate with in life </p>
